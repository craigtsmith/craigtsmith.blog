i move to amsterdam in 3 weeks.  
infact it's 2 weeks 6 days, 23 hours and 50 minutes.

not that i'm counting or anything.

except i am counting, and making lists, and freaking out, and getting 
hella excited and freaking out and cleaning things and freaking out and 
ticking things off lists, and getting excited and keeping busy and 
freaking out, and packing and searching for a house and freaking out 
and and and really i should be in bed.

but i'm not.  
because i'm super excited.  
(i'm freaking out.)

instead i setup this blog - because actually i _am_ super excited, and
i want somewhere to write about the adventure me & stuart are about to
embark on.

i'll write about the whys and wheres and what have yous another time, 
for now i'll just say...

"hello world"
