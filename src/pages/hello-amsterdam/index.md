we did it.  
i thought at times it might kill us.  
but we did it.  

a little over a week ago me & stuart packed up our lives, moved 
everything we own into storage and got on a one-way flight to our new 
life in amsterdam.

the past week and a bit has been surreal, trying desperately to find 
balance and normality in what is an entirely abnormal and precarious 
situation. living in temporary accommodation, half the team not working,
not registered as a "full resident" just yet & paying nearly 250% our
living costs vs. birmingham does not a stable or normal life make.    

normality is no more.  
time to find a new normal.  

moving out here has been a chance for us to both re-evaluate what we 
value in life, to change the way we live, how we spend our time and the 
way we find happiness around us. we've already made some changes to our 
routine that we want to continue with:

dinner is at the table. always.  
so is breakfast.  
and lunch.  
candle light in the evening.  
no tv.  
going for a walk beats sitting on a sofa.  
going to a pub beats drinking in your lounge.

for us moving to amsterdam was always about an adventure, a challenge, a
new chapter in the story of our lives. we decided, within hours of 
arriving that we were going to form and nurture new habits, for a 
happier, better life.

it still feels surreal.  
but it feels right.
